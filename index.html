        <h3>Context</h2>
        <p>I'm looking for a career change, so I'm following the Epicodus boot
          camp online.  As I go I'll learn new
          techniques and approaches. Building this portfolio:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Gives me practice and reinforces what I've learned</li>
          <li>Forces me to extend beyond the course material</li>
          <li>Demonstrates that I am can make a useful contribution to a team
        </ul>

        <h3>Racecar Game</h3>
        <p>While the game itself was an interesting project, I also wanted to build
           something that I could use for future refactoring projects based on what
            I will learn later in the course.

          At the point this project was started I had learned about HTML and Bootstrap,
           and some Javascript but not arrays and loops.</p>
        
        <h3>Product Backlog</h3>

        <ul>
          <li>Refactor all functions and ensure variables are appropriately glocal or local / 8 story point</li>
          <li>Make the card flip work through the shuffled stack of cards, rather than each card is random / 5 story point </li>
          <li>Change BigWheelCorvette to a model that is longer than it is wide / 1 story point</li>
          <li>Shuffle icons on track / 8 story points</li>
          <li>Capture track shape as a vector, build track as a data, then turn data into HTML / 144 story points</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Grid</h3>
        I wanted to build in the flexibility to place icons in different places in 
        future versions. At that point I didn't have the tool to properly isolate 
        the icon, so each icon had a black or grey edge of colour that would blend 
        with the background colour, as long as the icon was placed in exactly the right place. 
 
        I quickly found out that Bootstrap grid is fine for big blocks, but hopeless 
        for the level detail needed to turn a photograph of a floor mat into an onscreen 
        map. I found the grid tools, and built a system of a 20x20 grid that roughly 
        aligned to the playing squares. Within each grid, a subsidiary 3x3 grid was 
        built to allow exact placing of the icon. This then had to become a 4x4 grid 
        to allow placing of the cars. Then I discovered div contexts really matter 
        when trying to use z index to put cars on top of icons and then hiding them 
        behind icons.  The final solution of a very fine grid based on viewwidths 
        scales ended up providing a single div context and enough flexibility to 
        place every icon and car in the right place.
       
        <h3>Arrays and looping</h3>
        Part of the challenge was to build the game not using arrays (which I knew 
        about from Python but hadn't learned in Javascript).  I expect to learn 
        more powerful database tools than simple arrays. In the original game 
        successive cards are turned over from a stack of cards which is probably 
        almost ideal looping through a simple array. But currently each card 
        turn is a fresh 1 in 32 chance. I expect this will be an early 
        refactoring project.

        <h3>Global and local variables</h3>
        This was touched on briefly in the course but has not been properly applied. An early 
        refactoring project will be to address this issue.

        <h3>Graphic design and game play</h3>
        I have no pretention to be a graphic designer.  I love good visual 
        design but I have no skill in identifying what makes for good design, nor 
        have I invested time to learn graphic design tools. I found online 
        isolation tools in time to isolate the vehicles but not the icons. It 
        is doubtful I will bother refactoring the graphic design although it 
        clearly could do with some. There is a strange sequencing issue in 
        the card flip. Even though the flip comes at the end of the Javascript 
        sequence, it seems to not work unless there is a break.  The "Are you 
        ready" alert provides this break. In a similar way, there is a problem 
        with removing the vehicle when both cars are on the same spot, and this 
        is fixed by always removing the class from the shared spot positions, 
        irrespective of the number of cars on the spot.  These fixes are pretty 
        ugly, but they work and perhaps are of less interest to me to fix properly.
          
        <h3>Known Bugs</h3> 
        The "do you want to block repeated alerts" message on the alerts is 
        probably a setting somewhere that I will find at some point.
        It isn't possible to run web developer tools until the page is properly 
        loaded due to errors in the Bootstrap library.
